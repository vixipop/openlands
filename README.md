# Inspired by the Openlands Website (https://openlands.lvmh.com/) 

  I wanted to make a product configurator for a PC case in a futuristic setting; to practice creating an atmosphere.


  Future updates will include:
- Atmospheric Audio
- A configurator with UI
- Variations of the PC case (once i learn texturing with substance painter hehe)
